        <p>P.I. & Warehouse Operative.</p>
        <p>My name is Tim Morse.I am currently employed by Eddie Stobart as a P.I. operative, and as an occasional warehouse operative.</p>
        <p>I am currently seeking new employment, due to the evolving nature of my skillset, and I am seeking to further my career prospects.
        <p></p>I am hard working, conscientous by nature, and an articulate communicator with a diverse range of interests. I have a high level of fitness: I like to play and watch football, lift weights and enjoy long walks with my children. </p>
        <p>I would say my biggest strength is my determintaion to solve problems. I have been told that on several appraisals that I have the ability to come at any problem from different angles - if, or when, the first avenues don't work. This has lead me to resolve some very high cost
          losses in my current role. </p>
