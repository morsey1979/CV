  </ol>

  <p>I am looking to develop my skills into programming/coding (Python/JavaScript) and in Web Development, directories and databases - via Udemy courses, Codewars, the MDN site and various books/videos/lectures. <br> This is mainly as a hobby and to
    hopefully gain enough knowledge, and skill, to teach my children. I believe this knowledge is hugely benefitial to the future, and I hope to improve my abilities for any potential employer(s).</p>
